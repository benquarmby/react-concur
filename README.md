# react-concur
Materials for React workshop.

## Suggested Topics
- Demonstration of hosting react/redux in legacy screens
- Understanding the life cycle of server-side vs. client-side rendering
- Animations and integrating with redux state changes
- Don't unnecessarily invent prop names - align with HTML attribute names
- Server-side data loading vs. client-side data loading with componentDidMount as an anti-pattern unless in a HOC
- Fully-declared propTypes and detailed shape definitions
- Pluralization practices (localization)
- Unit testing components (what to test, what a unit is, how to stub 3rd party dependencies)
- what should NOT go into a component's state (issues with nui-widgets)

## In Progress

- Defining what code lives in a Presentational Component, mapStateToProps, and reducers (Cody Barrus)
- Separating the data access layer (Cody Barrus)
- when to use stateless components, and why (Cody barrus)
